# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
An analysis report has been requested to help Louise, a hopeful playwright, plan and budget her kickstarter campaigns. She is highly interested in developing project campaigns in the theatre category.   

## Analysis and Challenges
Let's start by mentioning that the analysis is based on the Kickstarter dataset, which is available here: [Kickstarter_Challenge](Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx.zip)

https://github.com/SilviaEiden/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx.zip

It is noted that Louiseâ€™s play "Fever" came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. The challenge is she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals, which is covered in the following section.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
From 2009 to 2017, there were a total of 839 successful Theatre campaigns or a 61% success rate from the grand total amount of campaigns created, which were 1,369. On average, there were 93 successful campaigns per year in all 9 years and across 21 countries worldwide. These findings are displayed in the line chart below where the blue line represents all successful theatre campaigns/kickstarters.

Based on the launch date, more plays were successful in reaching their fundraising goals during the Spring and Summer months. The month of May had the highest amount of campaigns reaching their goals with a total of 111, while June was a close second month with a total of 100 campaigns. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
If we take a further step to analyze the data... that pertains only to the subcategory "Plays", we can determine that out of 1,047 campaigns there were 694 campaigns with a successful outcome from 2009 to 2017.

If we narrow down our data... to only consider the subcategory "Plays", we can determine that out of 1,047 campaigns there were 694 campaigns with a successful outcome from 2009 to 2017.

A successful outcome means that a play received monetary pledges that either matchend or surpassed/exceeded its set financial goal. 

As shown in the graph below, the blue line displays the percentage of plays with a successful outcome per dollar-amount range. Furthermore, we can see that success rates varied largely due to their dollar-amount goals. Dollar-amount ranges of Less Than $1,000 and $1,000 to $4,999 generated the highest amount of plays that were able to achieve their financial goals, these are 141 and 388 plays respectively.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

One of the biggest challenges for Louise is the timing of her kickstarter campaigns. It seems like only one quarter of the year there is a high level of interest from backers to pledge for plays, which narrows down her chances of achieving her goals year-round. Ideally, Louise would get a better understanding of the people donating towards the plays and see if she is able to retain them or increase interest in other months besides the Spring and Summer.

The difficulties in these plays are not just on the timing but on the monetary goal as well. Kickstarter campaigns with goals above $5,000 have a 50% chance of achivieving its goal. Louise would have to revisit each goal and have a realistic approach when starting a kickstarter campaign. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Louise is very interested in developing kickstarter campaigns in the theatre category, specifically plays. The timing on these kickstarter campaigns is critical for their success. As stated earlier, the months of May and June showed higher success rates and this can guide Louise to better plan her campaigns throughout the year. Perhaps she can consider a strong marketing plan or an advertising promotion during the fall and winter months to generate as much pledges and interest in theatre from backers as possible.

Additionally, Louise could focus her efforts in Great Britain as well as in the United States as these are top markets for the Theatre. There were a total of 258 successful campaigns in Great Britain and a total of 525 in the United States out of a total of 839 campaigns worldwide. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Kickstarters for plays that have conservative goals such as less than $5,000 dollars are 74% more likely to reach their financial goals. The average number of backers per successful campaign was 56 with an average of $80 dollars per backer. With that said, perhaps Louise should think of extending the number of months to request financial pledges to improve the chances of a better outcome on her campaigns, especially the ones with much larger goals/goals higher than $10,000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

This dataset does have some limitations in which no additional information was provided that can describe further business efforts like marketing or advertising plans that were done or even considered. The data is solely based on efforts from kickstarter campaigns and the pledges received throughout the 9 years. So in a way its not giving a view of the whole picture. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

For this analysis we could create a bar chart that can depict months and dollar-amount ranges for specific subcategories such as musicals and plays and see how they compare overall. However, a line chart is well utilized in this analysis as we are looking to display trends of the kickstarter data that changes over time.
